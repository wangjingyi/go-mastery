# Topic J: Unit Testing & Mocking

> **Theory:** Table-driven tests. Mocking. Test doubles.

## Assignments

### 1. Table-Driven Tests
Write tests for a `Calculate` function using table-driven approach with subtests.

### 2. Test Coverage
Run `go test -cover` and achieve 80%+ coverage. Use `go tool cover -html`.

### 3. Mocking with Interfaces
Create an interface for external dependency. Mock it in tests.

### 4. Benchmarks
Write benchmarks comparing two implementations. Use `go test -bench`.

### 5. TestMain
Use `TestMain` for setup/teardown. Initialize test database before tests.
